Skin Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project aims to classify skin diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to classify various skin diseases into predefined categories, using dermatological images.

Project Overview

This project involves using deep learning techniques to classify images of skin lesions into various classes, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, and others. The model is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images, and the goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 180x180 pixel images of skin lesions, labeled according to different disease categories. The images represent different types of skin lesions such as:

Actinic Keratosis
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DermatoFibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented Benign Keratosis
Seborrheic Keratosis
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Vascular Lesion
Objective
The model aims to classify images into the above 9 classes, achieving a high level of accuracy.


Evaluation and Testing

After training the model, it can be evaluated on a test set of unseen images to assess its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall can be calculated to measure the classification performance.

Conclusion

The model is designed to classify skin diseases into different categories by learning from labeled images of skin lesions. It can be improved further by using techniques like data augmentation, fine-tuning the architecture, or using pre-trained models for transfer learning.

Future Improvements

Data Augmentation: To avoid overfitting and enhance model performance.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, etc., for better results.
Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters: Experiment with different learning rates, optimizers, and regularization techniques.
